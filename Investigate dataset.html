<p>NOTE: The positive correlation in between the budget and revenue can also be seen from the above graph. 
When one icreases the other does the same. However as one could see, the dot at the far right (the movie with the highest budget) did not get the highest revenue so this means higher budget does not guarantee higher revenues.</p>

<p>LIMITATION: As the database has around 10,000 movies and the similarity in the -revenue and budget- relationship, causes clusters and  it is hard to see every indiviual movies/budgets on the plot. However it still gives a general idea.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: 
            Yes, there is a positive correlation (70.68%) in between revenue and the budget.</p>

<pre><code>        The direction of the density in the scatter plot proves the same relationship. 

        This means higher budget movies have high possibility to get higher revenues.</code></pre>

<p>GOOD TO KNOW: 
    Here in this section and usually, I have used adjusted budget and revenue to be able to compare older data with the recent ones. 
    "_adj" shows the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inlation over time.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: 
            NO.The highest budget movie (The Warrior's Way) didn't get the highest profit.</p>

<pre><code>        The position shows that the most profitable movie is Star Wars.

        According to the previous correlation (question 1) , 

        high budget movies tend to have higher revenues but that  does   

        not mean higher profits.</code></pre>

<p>CONCLUSION: 
            Based on the first plot ,the popularity does not gurantee the highest revenue.</p>

<pre><code>        However as we can see the number of dots are increasing from bottom left corner to the top right corner.

        This is also true based on the correlation that has been done for the 1st question. 

        There we can see that there is a 54.92% positive corrrelation in between the popularity and adjusted revenue.  

        According to second plot, as the vote average gets higher , so does the revenue.</code></pre>
